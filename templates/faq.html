                <p> <b> Why has the login changed from username to email? </b></p>
                    <p> Social sign in is here! Our new identity management system is
                        currently being rolled out which will offer a lot of exciting
                        features for the Best Recipes audience in the future. </p>

                    <p>If you choose not to login via social media, you will need to use
                        your email address and existing password. </p>

                    <p> You will then need to enter your first and last name to complete
                        your profile within the 'registration' process. If you don't do this,
                        your form will error.</p>

                <h3 class="orange">Saving recipes</h3>
                <p> <b> How do I save a recipe? </b></p>
                    <p> Every recipe on the site can be saved and organised into personal
                        collections of folders in your own recipe book. To save just click
                        the on the save button, located directly underneath the recipe
                        description. You will be able to select an existing recipe book
                        or save into the default My Favourites folder.  You can access all
                        of your saved items by clicking on the Edit Profile button at the
                        top right corner of the page, and selecting My Recipe Book tab.  </p>

                <p> <b> How do I create a new folder in my Recipe Book?</b></p>
                    <p> To create a new folder, access your My Recipe Book in your profile.
                        Click on the New Folder button and give your new folder a name. At
                        this stage you can't create a new folder from a recipe page. You
                        can edit the folders name at any time by clicking on the edit button
                        (looks like a pencil) and re-naming the folder.   </p>

                <p> <b> How do I add one of my recipes? </b></p>
                    <p> You can add your original recipes on our Submit a Recipe page.
                        We've made some updates to our recipe submission form since we
                        relaunched in September 2014. We've heard your feedback that
                        it was a bit tricky or time-consuming to share a recipe so we've
                        simplified the process removing some mandatory fields and allowing
                        you to add ingredients and measurements as text. You can now take a
                        photo on your mobile phone or add it straight from your phone's
                        camera roll.    </p>

                <h3 class="orange">Reviews</h3>
                <p> <b> How do I make a comment or share a review of a recipe?</b></p>
                    <p> Only members are able to review and comment on recipes. The
                        comment/review section is at the bottom of each recipe. You
                        can leave a comment with what you thought of the recipe, any
                        changes you made or would make next time and a star rating
                        (1-5). We ask that our home cooks be polite and factual when
                        sharing their opinions of recipes. Our editorial team reserve
                        the right to remove or edit comments that  breach our terms
                        and conditions.   </p>

                <p> <b> How do I make a comment or share a review of a recipe?</b></p>
                    <p> If you'd like to make some changes to a recipe or a review
                        that you have submitted, you can send an email to team at
                        contactus@iDiet.com.sg Please include your username, the
                        recipe name, the URL of the recipe and the details of changes

                <h3 class="orange">Site updates</h3>
                <p> <b> Where has the menu planner gone to? </b></p>
                    <p> The menu planner was not moved over to the new Best Recipes.
                        We've found that our members aren't using the menu planner in
                        its current format but may re-invent this feature in future.   </p>

                <p> <b> I really miss a feature from the old site - are you going to bring it back? </b></p>
                    <p> The Best Recipes community is so passionate about creating and sharing
                        recipes. We're listening to your feedback and using this to help inform
                        the building of new features and fixing bugs and issues with the site.
                        If you have feedback please send the team an email at
